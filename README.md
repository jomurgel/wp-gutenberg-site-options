# WP Site Options
A WordPress Plugin that corresponds to a blog post [COMING SOON] on my
site which creates a Gutenberg-powered Site Options page utilizing Gutenberg UI.

## Setup
Run `nvm install` and `npm run build` for your production-ready plugin or `npm run start`
for development mode.

## Information
This approach adds a React app which utilizes Core WordPress Gutenberg dependencies to
manipulate site settings. By default this only edits the `posts_per_page` and `title`, but custom
elements or additional settings can be added with ease.
